![AD_icon_100](https://github.com/zihanzhao1999/CapstoneProject/assets/111836220/cc73e827-c1b6-47be-b790-8bf827ffe372)

## Introduction & Motivation:
In the field of healthcare, the integration of machine learning technologies has played an important role, particularly in the realm of disease diagnosis and management. A good machine learning model can shorten the time spent on diagnosis thus better support the treatment.
Our group aim to find better models with higher prediction accuracy to assist healthcare providers with patientsâ€™ diagnoses.

For now, we have implemented different models to be trained on the ground truth pathology and differential diagnosis. Please refer to `predict_pathology` and `predict_differential_diagnosis` folder.

Also, based on the best model(LSTM) and a simple inquiry system we invented, we implemented the Auto Diagnosis System.
Moreover, we have implemented a Streamlit app for the AD System. Please refer to `AD_system`.
